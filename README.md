# JavaScriptProjects

This is a collection of pure JavaScript, CSS, and HTML games I am using to work on my web development skills after my last summer internship at State Farm Insurance. At that internship I used jQuery and Bootstrap heavily, and I wanted to know the underlying techonologies better.

The projects are hosted here: https://students.cs.niu.edu/~z1861935/javascriptprojects/ .

## Space Intruders

This is a simple spin off of space invaders and was the first game I made. I developed this game in about a week.

## Astroids

This is a recreation of the old astroids game. I used this project to get more comfortable with the canvas in HTML and JavaScript.
