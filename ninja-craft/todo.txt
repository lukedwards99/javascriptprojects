CONCEPTS:

open world split into chunks. every chunk is a room in a labyrinth 

use maze algorithm already written to generate the maze

the closer to the exit the more difficult the rooms are

I can ignore the walls of the room and drawing the room with preset room
drawings

tiles placed in room are off grid and can move however they need

all objects in the room (other than the room itself) are intractable and destroyable

player can craft new items using what they collect to give them buffs
